    <h3>Our Why</h3>
    <p>With a new era of basketball approaching us now, Baloncesto Legacy was
      created with the goal of keeping basketball on an upwards trend. There's
      argument to whether basketball is a dying sport with how the game is
      changing and our goal is to keep it alive! Find everything basketball at
      Baloncesto Legacy.</p>
    <h3>Small Beginnings</h3>
    <p>Since we are so fresh to the market, many don't know what we offer. Our
      workers have spent countless hours researching the history of basketball
      to the smallest details. We've tracked down lost documentaries, beginning
      league jerseys, all different types of shoes, and so much more. Anything
      related to the game of basketetball can be found here.</p>
