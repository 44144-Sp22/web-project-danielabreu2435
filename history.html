    <h2>Start Up</h2>
      <p>We all know the huge names of basketball such as Micheal Jordan
        or Lebron James. These players are some of the biggest celebrities
        of the sport and have had a massive impact on the game of basketball.
        This being said, there were many players before them and are still to be
        plenty after. Basketball carries many different legacies and many more in
        the making and this organization sheds light on those legacies. </p>
    <h3>A New Era</h3>
      <p>Dwayne Wade has retired, Lebron is reaching one of the oldest ages of the league,
        and many players that we have known growing up are losing the spotlight.
        We are arriving on a new era of basketball. There are many new young players
        in the sport competing like Ja Morant, Luka Doncic, Donavan Mitchell. These
        players are taking the game by storm and Baloncesto Legacy was created in
        recognition of this new era. Although time is passing, we don't want to forget.
